# Commands

To execute a command, press space and type the command. There is fuzzy match support, so it is enough to type parts of the command name and it will display options that matches.

It is also possible to create a command file, extension `.sucl`, and run that. Running a command file can be done from within Surfer using the menu option in the File menu, through the toolbar button, or by typing the command ``run_command_file``. It can also be done using the ``--command-file`` argument when starting Surfer.

Not all commands are available unless a file is loaded. Also, some commands are not available in the WASM-build (browser/VS Code extension).

## Waveform/transaction loading and reloading

* ``load_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load a file. Note that it works to load a waveform file from a command file.

    <div class="warning">In WASM-builds (web browser/VS Code plugin) it is not possible to open a file due to file access restrictions. Use <tt>load_url</tt>.</div>


* ``switch_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load file, but keep waveform view.

* ``load_url <URL>``

    Load a URL.

* ``reload``

    Reload the current file. Does not work in a web browser.

* ``remove_unavailable``

    Remove variables that are not longer present in the reloaded/switched file.

## State files

* ``save_state``
* ``save_state_as``

## Command files

* ``run_command_file <FILE_NAME>`` (not on WASM)

    <div class="warning">In WASM-builds (web browser/VS Code plugin) it is not possible to run another command file from a command file due to file access restrictions.</div>

* ``run_command_file_from_url <URL>``

    Add all variables in the specified scope to the waveform display in a newly created group of the same name.

* ``scope_add_as_group_recursive <SCOPE_NAME>``

    Add all variables in the specified scope and all sub-scopes to the waveform display in a newly created groups nested.

    <div class="warning">Adding large hierarchies with a large number of variables can freeze surfer for a significant amount of time.</div>

* ``variable_add <FULL_VARIABLE_NAME>``, ``generator_add  <FULL_GENERATOR_NAME>``
