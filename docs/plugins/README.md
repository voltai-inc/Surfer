# Translators

Surfer supports custom translators that are loaded at runtime via web-assembly.

See additional documentation how to  [install](installing_plugins.md) and [write](writing_plugins.md) translator plugins.

If there is enough interest, we are contemplating hosting user-developed plugins in a central location.

It is also possible to use [decoders](decoders.md), which does not require writing your own custom translator.
